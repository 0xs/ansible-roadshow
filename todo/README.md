Magnus:
* Deploy enviroment using template instead of semi auto deployment via EC2 user data script.
* Create AMI for Tower?
* Replace IAM user/group with instance profile

Jacob/Magnus:
* Excercise needs description of, what it is the participant is building
* Excercise needs adjustment so that it can run on a smaller environment, instead of 3*number of participants.
* Description of using ssh from windows for labs (putty + cert setup)

Jacob:
* Add some content about error handling and how this is much better than with shell script.
* Maybe start by adding one server with wildfly and add other server later to show idempotence
* Preconfigured Profile to run EAP / undertow as a load balancer.
