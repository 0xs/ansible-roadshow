# Working with Ansible as code
A challenge when doing larger scale automation is to enable collaboration for people to work on the same pieces of automation together. Luckily for us, programmers has since long solved this issue for us using version handling systems, such as git.

Ansible does not require you to use git version handling, but there are some good reasons why you should familiarize yourself with it.

When you scale out your Ansible usage (aka. automate all things) you’ll have many different teams collaborating, and:
1. Git was invented to solve common collaboration challenges
2. Git has earned its worldwide popularity the hard way and is in the core of many of the world’s most popular collaboration services and products

Take some time and think about the different teams or people that you would like to collaborate with.
